Title: Minor refresh

Just went through the source and did a proper, responsive-style upgrade to [Bootstrap 2.0.1][tb]. 

There hasn't been much time to delve into the engine itself other than to pinpoint some places where markup residue needs to be eliminated or moved outside into further templating, and some new tweaks are yet to be merged into the public codebase.
