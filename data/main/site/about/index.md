This site is running on a high-performance [Python][p]-based CMS/Wiki called [Yaki][y].

[Yaki][y] is entirely flat-file based and relies on several internal caching mechanisms to withstand things like sustained referrals from [Slashdot][s] (where all the old folk read news), [Hacker News][hn] (where all the kids read news) and the general ebb and flow of Internet tsunamis of various descriptions.

It supports [Textile][t], [Markdown][m] and plain [HTML][h] as markup, has magical inter-page linking, full-text indexing and searching, extensive syntax highlighting support for source code and technical docs, and generally avoids breaking your content by default.
