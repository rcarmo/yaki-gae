This page may break suddenly - it's supposed to, since it's the sandbox where I try out new plugins and other tidbits.

Here's the last blog post:

<plugin name="Journal" size="1" src="^blog\/.+"/>

And now, the 3-4 previous posts before that:

<plugin name="latestentries" size="4" src="^blog\/.+"/>

And finally, a more compact linkblog format (to be used as a single horizontal row later on):

<plugin name="latestlinks" size="5" src="^links\/.+"/>
