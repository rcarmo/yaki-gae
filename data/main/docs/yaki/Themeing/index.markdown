Title: Themeing Yaki

A brief outline:

* Themes are plain HTML with [Bottle][b] template syntax and CSS
    * HTML and templating lives inside `views`.
    * CSS, JS, fonts, etc. are a custom version of the [InK][i] CSS framework, and live inside `static`.

> **TODO:** Detail how to use [Bottle][b] templating for RSS feeds and partials
