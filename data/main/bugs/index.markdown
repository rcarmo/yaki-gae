Title: Bugs

# Lingering:

1. Extension doesn't provide enough hints as to content type
2. Sort out metadata templates
3. Can't search for things ending in '.py'

# Improvements:

1. Need to test BatchWriter and AsyncWriter
2. Index data files (PDFs, mostly)

# Apparently fixed: 

1. Searching for words of which there were unique occurrences
